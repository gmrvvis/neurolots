NeuroLOTs and NeuroTessMesh 
=====================================================

## Introduction
NeuroLOTs is a set of libraries and tools for generating neuronal meshes and for 
visualizing them at different levels of detail using GPU-based tessellation.
As a part of NeuroLOTS, NeuroTessMesh provides a visual environment for the 
generation of 3D polygonal meshes that approximate the membrane of neuronal 
cells, from the morphological tracings that describe the morphology of the 
neurons. The 3D models can be tessellated at different levels of detail, 
providing either homogeneous or adaptive resolution along the model. The soma 
shape is recovered from the incomplete information of the tracings, applying a 
physical deformation model that can be interactively adjusted.

See [NeuroTessMesh web page](http://gmrv.es/neurotessmesh/) and 
[NeuroTessMesh  manual](http://gmrv.es/neurotessmesh/NeuroTessMeshUserManual.pdf)
for a complete description and sample data tests.

## Dependencies

* Required dependencies:
    * nsol
    * eigen3

* Optional dependencies:
    * Qt5.4: enables building NeuroTessMesh viewer (*)
    * ZeroEQ: enables syncing selections and syncing camera
    * Lexis: provides the base vocabulary for ZeroEQ for sync operations
    * gmrvLex: enables sending focus messages

Note: nsol library is automatically downloaded and built if not found by cmake.  

Note: Qt version 5.4 or above is mandatory to build NeuroTessMesh.

## Building

NeuroTessMesh has been successfully built and used on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Mac OSX Yosemite
and Windows 10 64-bits with Visual Studio 2015. Please ensure that you build the
Release version in order to get the best performance possible.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.gmrv.es/hbp/neurolots.git
mkdir neurolots/build && cd neurolots/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

## Running

If building process was OK, you can try NeuroTessMesh with the command:

```bash 
./bin/NeuroTessMesh -swc nsol/tests/ExampleNeuron.swc
```

All the features can be accessed using the NeuroTessMesh GUI but some of them
are also available through CLI. Running the following can provide a list of
the CLI arguments NeuroTessMesh accepts:

```bash 
./bin/NeuroTessMesh --help
```

In order to check which optional dependencies have been used, the following 
command can be used:

```bash 
./bin/NeuroTessMesh --version
```
